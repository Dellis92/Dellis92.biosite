                        <p>Here we have some modest decoration that Jasmine picked out herself. Neutral colors and a warm home appeal. As well she loves to include small touches such as decorative candles and other miscellaneous decorations.</p>

                        <p>Many games and consoles belonging to Jasmine and myself. All together this isn't everything we own, and even though I am the bigger gamer of the two of us, she has loved and grown up with it just as much as anyone else.</p>

                        <p>A few Nintendo 64 games that Jasmine owns. Of course these are older, but there are quite a few gems in there. I mean come on, who doesn't love Mario Kart and Smash Bros?</p>

        <h4>A few hobbies</h4>
        <p>Above we have a few of her hobbies. Nothing too out of the ordinary if we're being honest.</p>
        <p>Gaming is something we both share a love of. Since childhood she's grown up with games, same as me, and I'm sure some of you</p>
        <p>Interior decorating, or in this case, just furniture in general is an interest she got from her family, specifically her mom who is an avid HGTV watcher</p>
        <p>While there aren't a ton of pictures, hopefully the ones here show you a bit about Jasmine.</p>
